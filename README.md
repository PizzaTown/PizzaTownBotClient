**Rocky43007's own Discord Client**

Welcome to Rocky's own Discord Client. This is his attempt at trying to understand how Gateways and Bot libraries work. This is a crude imitation of Discord.js, but has been fully written in Typescript. Enjoy!


Steps:

1. Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual Discord Bot Token in `test.js`.

2. Test using `npm start` to try the `test.js` file that Rocky has written for testing.
