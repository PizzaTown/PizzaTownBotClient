**Rocky43007's own Discord Client**

Welcome to Rocky's own Discord Client. As usual, he's trying to do something complicated, which he doesn't need to do. 


Steps:

1. Edit `config.json.text` and fill out the information required there. Save the file as `config.json`.

2. Test using `npm start` to try the `index.ts` file that Rocky has written for testing.
