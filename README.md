**Rocky43007's own Discord Client**

Welcome to Rocky's own Discord Client. This is his attempt at trying to understand how Gateways and Bot libraries work. This is a crude imitation of Discord.js, but has been fully written in Typescript. Enjoy!


Steps:

1. Make a config.json file that looks like this:
```json
{
  "token": {
        "beta": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
    },
}
```
2. Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual Discord Bot Token.

3. Test using `npm start` to try the `index.ts` file that Rocky has written for testing.
